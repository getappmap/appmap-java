# Use -r to discover tests. It comes with a couple of caveats:
#
#   * it has problems reporting test scripts errors, i.e. problems in the scripts themselves, not
#     with commands they run. If you see failures that don't have sensible errors messages, try
#     something like
#
#     $ bats $(find test/!(http_client) -name \*.bats)
#
#   * just doing bats -r test doesn't discover a setup_suite.bash file correctly. http_client uses
#     one, so it needs to be run separately

bats -r test/!(http_client)
bats -r test/http_client
